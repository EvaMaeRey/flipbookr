# The flipbookr package

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

“Flipbooks” present side-by-side, aligned, incremental 
code-output evolution via automated code parsing and reconstruction.
Like physical flipbooks, they let the 'reader' watch a scene evolve at
their own pace. Flipbooks seek to reduce the guesswork involved
between code and its behavior by presenting substeps of a coding
pipeline; the reader of a flipbook observes the partial code that is
used to create “A.1”, “A.2”, “A.3” etc. all the way up to “B”. 

Here's the 'minimal flipbook' template that's available with the package:

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbookr/minimal_flipbook.gif")
```

The create a flipbook isn't hard because parsing and reconstruction of code
pipelines into substeps is automated!

```



## Installation

You can install the development version of flipbookr with devtools as
follows:

``` r
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")
```

You will most likely use this package with the rmarkdown presentation
tool, Xaringan, which is available on CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("xaringan")
```

## Template

The package includes a template for building a flipbook that
demonstrates various flipbooking modalities; the template can also be
accessed from within RStudio (New File -\> RMarkdown -\> From Template
-\> A Minimal Flipbook)
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/minimal-flipbook/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd).
  Here is a preview: 

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbooks/blob/master/flipbookr/skeleton.gif?raw=true")
```

The full flipbook, an html slideshow, that you can advance at your own pace, can be viewed
[here](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/flipbookr/skeleton#1).



## Intuition about how it works

We believe in communicating with flipbooks, so we use the tool to
describe the functions that are at work within the package
[here](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/flipbookr/flipbookr_building_blocks#1)
