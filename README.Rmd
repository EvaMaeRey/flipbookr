# The flipbookr package

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

“Flipbooks” present side-by-side, aligned, incremental 
code-output evolution via automated code parsing and reconstruction.
Like physical flipbooks, they let the 'reader' watch a scene evolve at
their own pace. Flipbooks seek to reduce the guesswork involved
between code and its behavior by presenting substeps of a coding
pipeline; the reader of a flipbook observes the partial code that is
used to create “A.1”, “A.2”, “A.3” etc. all the way up to “B”. 

Here's the 'minimal flipbook' template that's available with the package:

[View flipbook in a new tab](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbookr/minimal_flipbook.html){target="_blank"}

```{r, echo = F, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbookr/minimal_flipbook.gif")
```

The create a flipbook isn't hard because parsing and reconstruction of code
pipelines into substeps is automated!

flipbookr's `chunk_reveal()` disassembles a single code chunk and creates the "build" of multiple partial-code chunks on different slides (the --- is automatically generated for you too).  

Check out the details on how to do this in this [*doublecrocheted* version of the same flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbookr/minimal_flipbook_double_crochet.html){target="_blank"} (quotes the .Rmd source on some slides).

## Installation

You can install the development version of flipbookr with devtools as
follows:

``` r
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")
```

You will most likely use this package with the rmarkdown presentation
tool, Xaringan, which is available on CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("xaringan")
```

## Template

The package includes several templates for building a flipbook that
demonstrates various flipbooking modes. 

The templates can be accessed from within RStudio.  For example: New File -\> RMarkdown -\> From Template -\> A Minimal Flipbook.  The templates are:

- A Minimal Flipbook
- Most Flipbookr Features, [preview output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/minimal-flipbook/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd){target="_blank"}
- A Python Flipbook

## How it works:

[Here's](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/flipbookr/flipbookr_building_blocks#1) a flipbook going through some of the internal flipbookr functions. 


```{r sample_chunk}
library(tidyverse)
Titanic %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  uncount(Freq) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = Sex) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  aes(fill = Survived)
```



## Coming soon

```{r, eval = F}
chunk_reveal_live(chunk_name = "sample_chunk")
```


# how am I using rstudioapi wrong?

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbookr/", destfile = "myhtml.html")
rstudioapi::viewer("myhtml.html")
```
