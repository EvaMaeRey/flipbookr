<!-- Hi there!  It's me, the developer.  So that I can sometimes work interactively on the package, I still am making the local source script available for myself - the code in the following chunk is for this purpose.  It will just work for your, but because I'm using "try" it won't throw an error for you!-->

```{r just_for_evamaerey, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
try(source("../../../../../R/base_parse_reveal_xaringan.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/mini.R"))
```


You can try a flipbook mini.  At this time, the output can *only* be plots






```{r my_source_code_chunk, include = F}
ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, 
             alpha = .8,
             size = 5,
             color = "white") +
  aes(fill = dist) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", end = .7) +
  labs(title = "That cars data again!") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "snow3")) 
```

# Let's see the build

I'm also echoing the code.  It produces the gif (saved externally) and then embeds it in the html file. 

```{r, echo = T}
chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = "my_source_code_chunk",
                         title = "Side-by-side co-evolution!") 
```

# Or maybe just output is of interest?


```{r, echo = F}
chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = "my_source_code_chunk",
                         title = "That's pretty!", 
                         display_type = "output") 
```

# Or maybe just code is of interest?



```{r, echo = F}
chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = "my_source_code_chunk",
                         title = "What do you think this will build?", 
                         display_type = "code") 
```
