This is pretty experimental work.  The python "parser" (basically no parsing) means there are strong constraints on code.  Each new line must yield complete code statement...  


```{r setup, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      comment = "", cache = F, fig.retina = 3, eval = F)
library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
```


<!-- This next chunk is just for the developer -- working w/ local code -->

```{r just_for_evamaerey, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = T}
try(source("../../../../../R/base_parse_reveal_xaringan.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/mini.R"))

`r chunk_reveal("hello_python", lang = "python")`


```{python hello_python, include = F}
[1, 4] * 8
3 + 4 * 8 
2 + 6

4 * 8
[1,2] + [3,4,5,6]
import numpy as np
np.reshape(np.arange(1,25), 
    (4,3,2), "F")
["hello", "world!", 
    1, 2, 3] * 2

  1990, 2010]
