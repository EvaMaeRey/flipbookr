This is pretty experimental work.  The python "parser" (basically no parsing) means there are strong constraints on code.  Each new line must yield complete code statement...  


```{r, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = "", cache = F, dev = "svg", fig.ext = "svg")
# library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
```


<!-- This next chunk is just for the developer -- working w/ local code -->

```{r just_for_evamaerey, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = T}
try(source("../../../../../R/a_create_test_code.R"))

`r chunk_reveal("hello_python", lang = "python")`


```{python hello_python, include = F}
[1, 4] * 8

3 + 4 * 8 

2 + 6

4 * 8

[1,2] + [3,4,5,6]

["hello", "world!", 1, 2, 3] * 2

import numpy as np

np.reshape(np.arange(1,25), 
    (4,3,2), "F")
```

`r chunk_reveal("simple_plot", lang = "python", widths = c(59,40))`


```{python simple_plot, include = F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
year = [1950, 1970, 
  1990, 2010]
pop = [2.519, 3, 5, 6]
plt.plot(year, pop); plt.show()
```

`r chunk_reveal("numpy", lang = "python")`


```{python numpy, include = F}
# import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
t = np.arange(0, 2, .05)
t
s = np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
s
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("numpy2", lang = "python")`


```{python numpy2, include = F}
plt.plot(t, s)
plt.xlabel('time (s)')
plt.ylabel('voltage (mV)')
plt.grid(True); plt.show()
```

`r chunk_reveal("prep", lang = "python", break_type = 1)`

```{python prep, include = F}
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd 

student_scores = pd.DataFrame(
{"student": ["Andy", "Bernie", "Cindy", "Deb"],
"sex": ["M", "M", "F", "F"],
"english": [98, 95, 70, 40], # eng grades
"math": [66, 89, 60, 70], # math grades
"physics": [78, 90, 92, 88] # physics grades
}) 

student_scores 
```


---

## Now lets find the highest three grades among all of these grades.  This is done by reshaping the data, sorting it decending order, and selecting the top three rows. 

---

`r chunk_reveal("bam", lang = "python", widths = c(1,1))`

```{python bam, include = F}
student_scores \
  .melt(id_vars=['student', "sex"], 
        var_name="subject", 
        value_name="final_grade") \
  .sort_values(by=['final_grade'], ascending=False) \
  .head(3)
```
