This is an example of where we try to embed an html flipbook in a larger html package.  

```{r, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = "", cache = F)
library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r my_code, eval = F}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = dist) +
  aes(y = speed) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r}
knitr::knit_code$get("my_code") %>% 
  paste(collapse = "\n") %>% 
  writeLines("temp.R")

write_instant_flipbook(file = "instant1.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("instant1.Rmd", quiet = T)
```


```{r}
knitr::include_url(url = "skeleton.html")
```






```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}

@media print {
  .has-continuation {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
