This template aimed at doing the following:  preparing a flipbook within an .Rmd file, which we can *embedded* the in the resulting html.  Narrative might be interspersed between the code-movies.  

How we get this done:

1. write some code in a code chunk
2. save that code out as text
3. create an "instant flipbook"
    - create an .Rmd file that will bring in code
    - render that file to an html xaringan slide show
4. embed the flipbook upon knitting the container doc to .html


```{r, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = "", cache = F)
library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
save.image("current_image.Rdata")
```

```{r just_for_evamaerey, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
try(source("../../../../../R/a_create_test_code.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/b_parsing.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/c_prep_sequences.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/d_prep_rmd_chunks.R"))

try(source("../../../../../R/f_chunk_expand.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/g_exported_functions.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/h_write_instant_flipbook.R"))
```

```{r my_code, echo = F}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = dist) +
  aes(y = speed) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "cool plot") ->
g
```

```{r, echo = F}
g
```


# So how can we make it? 

```{r, echo=F}
build_instant_flipbook(chunk_name = "my_code", use_share_again = T)
```

# Going further

```{r further, echo = F}
g + 
  aes(size = dist) +
  aes(color = dist) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "distance") +
  labs(y = "Speed")
```
```{r, echo=F}
build_instant_flipbook(chunk_name = "further", use_share_again = T)
```



```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}

@media print {
  .has-continuation {
    display: block;
  }
}
