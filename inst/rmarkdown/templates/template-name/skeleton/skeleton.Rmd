# "Flipbooks"? 

“Flipbooks” are tools that present side-by-side, aligned, incremental code-output evolution via automated code parsing and reconstruction. More about Flipbooks [here](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/about/what_the_flipbook).  There now exists a package for making Flipbooks for R: `flipbookr`.  This is under development, but you are welcome to try it out by installing from github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")
```

You can see the template that was used to build this flipbook that you are looking at right now  [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/template-name/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd).


Or, once you install the package (and restart RStudio?) a template for making the flipbook that you are looking at will also be available from within RStudio, File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> "A Minimal Flipbook".

# How Flipbooking with Xaringan works

The flipbook you will be building here uses a member of the [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) family called [Xaringan (presentation ninja)](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), which creates a slideshow in html.  Dynamic documents like `rmarkdown` documents allow you to comingle code and prose in a single document.  

It may be obvious by now, if you are following along with the source template, that slide breaks are indicated with `---` (be careful trailing white space is not allowed)

---


Flipbooks are built by spawning new *partial* code chunks from a single, user-input code chunk.  The partial code chunks build up and are display consecutively in a slide show alongside its output which yields a movie-like experience; this should make each step easier to understand.  

As you begin with flipbooks, I'd recommend using the code chunk option `include = F` for your "source" code chunks, and with no caching throughout.  As you begin to get more comfortable with flipbooking, you might change these choices.


---

## Set-up

We use the flipbookr package, of course! This does the work of disassembling a single code chunk and creating the "build" of multiple partial-code chunks.  This is at the top of this file in the "setup" code chunk.

Also, at the top of this template in that "setup" code chunk, I set *code chunk* options for the code chunks that follow.  These will apply to the spawned code chunks.

<!-- Hi there!  It's me, the developer.  So that I can sometimes work interactively on the package, I still am making the local source script available for myself - the code in the following chunk is for this purpose.  It will just work for your, but because I'm using "try" it won't throw an error for you!-->

```{r just_for_evamaerey, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
try(source("../../../../../R/base_parse_reveal_xaringan.R"))
try(source("../../../../../R/mini.R"))
```



---

# Using `flipbookr::chunk_reveal()`

You will use the `chunk_reveal()` function [inline](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-4.html) to generate the derivitive code chunks, rather than inside of a code chunk, so that the text that is generated is interpreted correctly when rendered.  The inline code will look something like this:

<!-- The above is for the html output version, just look at the examples below if you are in the source! -->
```markdown
``r "r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = \"cars\", break_type = \"user\")"``
``` 


There are several modalities that you might be interested in using for "flipbookifying" your code and the next section is dedicated to demoing some of them below.

- **break type** -- *which lines of code should be revealed when*, `break_type` defaults to "auto"
- **display type** -- *display code and output, or just output, or just code?*, `display_type` defaults to "both"
- **assignment type** -- *does code chunk use left assignment?*, `left_assign` defaults to FALSE







---

At first we'll apply our flipbooking to the below input code - the code chunk is named "cars".  For now I set echo = TRUE for this code chunk, so you can see the code content but sometimes you might like to set echo to FALSE. This code uses tidyverse tools, so we loaded that too in the "setup" code chunk at the beginning of the template. 

```{r cars, include = FALSE}
cars %>%
  filter(speed > 4) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) + #BREAK
  geom_point(
    alpha = .3, #BREAK2
    color = "blue" #BREAK3
    ) + #BREAK
  aes(size = speed) #BREAK
```





---

# `break_type`

Notice the regular comments and the special #BREAK comments, these will be used for a couple of the different "break type" modalities.


```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

<!-- Also notice how we've created a new code chunk with the code from the previous chunk by calling knitr::knit_code$get("cars"). -->
<!-- This slide is also about giving you some intuition about how flipbooking works in the background. -->
<!-- (more on this [here](https://emitanaka.rbind.io/post/knitr-knitr-code/)) -->


---

## break_type = "auto"

One parameter of flipbooking is the break_type.  The default is "auto", in which appropriate breakpoints are determined automatically --- by finding where parentheses are balanced. 

<!-- display the user input code as a refresher -->
```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

  

---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "auto")`

---

## break_type = "user", with #BREAK

If the break_type is set to "user", the breakpoints are those indicated by the user with the special comment #BREAK

<!-- display the user input code as a refresher -->
```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "user")`




---

## break_type = "non_seq", with #BREAK2, #BREAK3

If the break_type is set to "non_seq", the breakpoints are those indicated by the user with the special numeric comment #BREAK2, #BREAK3 etc to indicate at which point in time the code should appear.  

<!-- display the user input code as a refresher -->
```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```



---


`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "non_seq")`


---

# break_type = "rotate", with #ROTATE, #ROTATE, #ROTATE

you can use break_type = "rotate" to cycle through distinct lines of code.  Sometimes, you will need to set the chunk option to eval = F, echo = F instead of include = F.  This will be true when the input code itself cannot be executed. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("my_rotate", break_type = "rotate")`

```{r my_rotate, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = cars) +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(color = speed) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "magma") + #ROTATE
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "cividis") + #ROTATE
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "plasma") #ROTATE
```



---

## `break_type = 5` (or "entering the multiverse")

Another modality is to set break_type equal to a positive integer, indicating that you want the same code chunk to be displayed multiple times.  This makes the most sense in a setting where there is some randomization or random sampling and you want to see different realizations. Let's see this used on the user input code chunk "cars_multi", whose first step is to randomly sample rows from the data set cars with replacement.  

```{r cars_multi, include = FALSE, fig.height=5}
cars %>% 
  sample_frac(size = 1, replace = TRUE) %>%      
  ggplot() +              
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_count(
    alpha = .3,
    color = "blue" 
    ) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = range(cars$speed),
                  ylim = range(cars$dist)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.9, .2))
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars_multi", break_type = 3)`


---

# `display_type`

There are also different display modalities.  Namely you can indicate if you want "both" the code and the output displayed in your flipbookification, or just the "output" (perhaps to be used in a traditional presentation), or just the "code" (which might be used to kind of test student expectations about some code).  You have already seen the default where the parameter display_type is set to "both", but let's have a look at "output" and "code" only.


---

## `display_type = "output"`

Let's look at where only the *output* is displayed for the "cars" code chunk.


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "auto", display_type = "output")`

---

## `display_type = "code"`

And now where only the *code* is displayed for the "cars" code chunk.


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "auto", display_type = "code")`

---

## `display_type = c("output", "code")`

Not sure why you'd want to do this, but you can flip output and code.  It's also not totally stable - jumps moving from tabular output to figure.  Have to figure that one out. It is something to do with fixed height.


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "auto", display_type = c("output", "code"))`

---

## `display_type = c("md", "code"), md = c("hi", "by")`

Include a panel for markdown.  Double backslashes required to escape.



---

`r chunk_reveal("custom_example", md = c("### hello", "# goodbye", "## $$\\frac{\\sum(x)}{2}$$"), display_type = c("md", "code"))`




```{r custom_example, include=F}
library(magrittr)

cars %$%
  cor(x = speed,
      y = dist)
```




---

## `display_type = "func"`

to display underlying functions that the code pipeline is using...

---

`r chunk_reveal("rnorm", display_type = c("code", "func", "output"), widths = c(32, 32, 33))`

```{r rnorm, include=F}
rnorm(50) %>% 
  sd() %>% 
  length()
```




---
class: middle, inverse, center

# `title = "## My title"`

Give your little flipbook a title if you like...

---

# `widths = c(32, 32, 33)`

depending on how many display panels you have, you can adjust relative widths with a vector

---

`r chunk_reveal("cars3", title = "## A title several widths", widths = c(22, 30, 40), display_type = c("code", "func", "output"))`


```{r cars3, include=F}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(size = speed)
```




---

# Assignment

If you want to create an object in your flipbooks, it is most "natural" to use [right assignment](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html).  Working sequentially with a pipeline of code, you get feedback all along the way until you get to the point of assigning all of what you have done to a new object with right assignment.  Creating objects in one "source" code chunk, means that you can break up a pipeline of tasks into multiple code chunks.  Let's see this in action.


---

`r chunk_reveal("plot_object")`

```{r plot_object, include = FALSE}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point() ->
cars_plot
```


---


`r chunk_reveal("further_building")`

```{r further_building, include = FALSE}
cars_plot +
  labs(x = "Speed (mph)") + 
  labs(y = "Stopping distance (ft)")
```






---


# `left_assign = TRUE`


With left assignment in R, you don't get any feedback, so flipbooking prefers this step at the end of a pipeline, so we can enjoy all the nice feedback. So the parameter left_assign is by default set to FALSE.


But, setting the left_assign paramter to T and using left assignment, you can still create a meaningful flipbook that gives you feedback.   When left_assign = TRUE, the first object that is created prints at the end of the derivative code chunks. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("left_assign", break_type = "auto", display_type = "both", left_assign = TRUE)`


```{r left_assign, include = FALSE}
my_plot <- cars %>%   # the data  
  filter(speed > 4) %>%  # subset
  ggplot() +       # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point()
```




---

# Managing source code chunks

So, it is pretty cool that we can create a bunch of derivative code chunks from one input code chunk (a foundational blog post by Emi Tanaka on this [here](https://emitanaka.rbind.io/post/knitr-knitr-code/)).  But there are some considerations then for this source chunk.  What should its chunk options be?  The easy way is to set all "source" code chunks to include = F, as I do throughout the book.  However, you might consider a combination of `eval` and `echo` instead; you can come back to this idea as you become a more seasoned flipbooker.    



---

# Beyond the tidyverse

It is no surprise that Flipbooks are born in the context of the popularity of the tidyverse tools --- tools that are designed be be used in sequential pipelines and that give a satisfying amount of feedback along the way!

But base R techniques and other popular tools can certainly also be employed.  

---

# "chaining" by overwriting objects

---

`r chunk_reveal("left_assign2", break_type = "auto", display_type = "both", left_assign = TRUE)`


```{r left_assign2, include = FALSE}
cars_mod <- cars
cars_mod$half_dist <- cars$dist / 2
names(cars_mod)[2] <- "distance"
cars_mod <- cars_mod[cars_mod$distance > 10,]
cars_mod <- cars_mod["distance"]
```


---

## using the .[] and .[[]] syntax with the migrittr pipe - %>%

Flipbooking can also be applied to logical indexing workflows if the steps are broken up using the %>% followed by .[] and .[[]].  Thus flipbooking can also be used with base R logical indexing and with the popular `data.table` package. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("dot_notation")`

```{r dot_notation, include = FALSE}
cars %>% 
  .[cars$speed > median(cars$speed),] %>% 
  .["speed"] %>% 
  .[,1] ->
top_speeds
```

---


# Base R plotting

It has been a while since I've done much plotting with base R, but I think it is important to have an example or two. 

---

`r chunk_reveal("base_r_plotting")`

```{r base_r_plotting, include = FALSE}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", 
     ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, 
             f = 2/3, iter = 3), 
      col = "red")
title(main = "the `cars` data")
title(sub = "Data is from Ezekiel's (1930) 'Methods of Correlation Analysis'.")
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars_anova")`

```{r cars_anova, include = FALSE, fig.keep='none'}
## An example of polynomial regression
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", 
     ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
    las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))

lm(dist ~ poly(speed, 3), 
   data = cars) -> 
model

seq(0, 25, length.out = 25) ->
inputs_of_x  

predict(model, 
        data.frame(speed = inputs_of_x)) ->
prediction_y

lines(inputs_of_x, 
      prediction_y, 
      col = "blue")
```

---

# And arithmetic operations

---

`r chunk_reveal("arith")`

```{r arith, include = FALSE}
(4 + 5) / # just be careful
  6 * # because order of operations 
  7 - # hold
  3 * # contrasting to pipe logic
  12 # PEMDAS

1:10 %%
  3

1:10 %/%

  matrix(1:4, nrow = 1)

matrix(1:4, ncol = 4) %*%
  matrix(1:4, nrow = 4)
```





---

A new addition is the %$% pipe from the magrittr library.  And example follows. 

---

`r chunk_reveal("new_pipe")`

```{r new_pipe, include=F}
library(magrittr)

cars %$%
  cor(x = speed,
      y = dist)
```





---
class: middle, inverse, center

# `text_reveal`

--

use text_reveal, and define a delimiter.

---

`r text_reveal("This is my text.", sep = " ")`

---

```{r, echo = F}
"Sometimes, it's helpful to slow down and look at exactly one decision.| Flipbooks present code step-by-step and side-by-side with output.| They parse code pipelines.| Reconstruct code into partial builds.| And present those builds with their output.| Both code and output are superimposed on the previous state." ->

```


`r text_reveal(text = philosophy, sep = "\\|")`

## Xaringan slide show look and feel

To quickly change the look and feel of your {xaringan} slide show, you might check out the [available themes](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes#avaliable-themes) from the xaringan package and [xaringanthemer](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer) package.

Another extremely useful resource for xaringan styling is Alison Hill's ["Meet xaringan: Making slides in R Markdown"](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html).

# Sharing your flipbooks

Flipbooks created with Xaringan are multi-file creations.  The figures produced are stored separately from the main html document.  This presents a little bit of a challenge for sharing your work.  You can zip up all the associated files and share that way.  Alternatively, you can share as a website.  I've shared my work on github with github pages.  

- flip, zip, and ship
- get it on github, with github pages.  A good walk through is the one that I learned with (to get [the ggplot2 flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html) online) is by Brian Caffo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCesiebEuQ  Larger flipbooks will take longer to load in the browser - something to keep in mind as you are building. 
- print to pdf using pagedown::chrome_print()


---

## Convert to pdf

to create a pdf from you may use the pagedown package as follows to use chrome print to pdf (here, eval is set to FALSE):

```{r, eval = F}
pagedown::chrome_print(input = "my_flipbook.Rmd")

# or (recommended):

pagedown::chrome_print(input = "my_flipbook.html")
```

Note:  This works for flipbooks when css is set as it is in the last css code chunk (the media print part) else only the last frame from the flipbooked chunks will display in the pdf.  Thanks to Bryan Shalloway for thinking about conversion to pdf, [the exposition of this last frame problem, and proposing a solution](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/issues/21) and also to Antoine Bichat! Be sure to preview your work before you present --- translation might not be 100% visual match!

---

## flipbook preview -- as gif

If you want to create a preview of your flipbook, you can pass the pdf to functions from magick (here, eval is set to FALSE):  

```{r, eval = F}
# then create gif as follows
magick::image_read_pdf(path = "my_flipbook.pdf", density = 100) %>% # create images
  magick::image_write_gif(path = "my_flipbook.gif", delay = .4) # images to gif
```

Bryan Shalloway proposed this workflow.  Thanks Bryan!

Coming soon, build a previews, using [viztoc](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/viztoc). Development package!  Breaking changes are the norm!
