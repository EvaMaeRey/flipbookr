# Welcome

- Yes, there is now a package called `flipbookr`
--

- Yes, it's still under construction (thus, the dramatic "fragile" and "perilous")
--

- Yes, you can help make it less fragile and perilous by letting us know if/how it breaks and frustrates you and/or contributing at https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr!  
--

- Then we'll retitle this book!

# "Flipbooks"? 

“Flipbooks” are tools that present side-by-side, aligned, incremental code-output evolution via automated code parsing and reconstruction. More about Flipbooks [here](https://evamaerey.github.io/little_flipbooks_library/about/what_the_flipbook).  There now exists a package for making Flipbooks for R: `flipbookr`.  This is under development, but you are welcome to try it out by installing from github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/flipbookr")
```

You can see the template that was used to build this flipbook that you are looking at right now  [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/template-name/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd).


Or, once you install the package (and restart RStudio?) a template for making the flipbook that you are looking at will also be available from within RStudio, File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> "A Minimal Flipbook".

# How Flipbooking with Xaringan works

The flipbook you will be building here uses a member of the [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) family called [Xaringan (presentation ninja)](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), which creates a slideshow in html.  Dynamic documents like `rmarkdown` documents allow you to comingle code and prose in a single document.  

It may be obvious by now, if you are following along with the source template, that slide breaks are indicated with `---` (be careful trailing white space is not allowed)

---


Flipbooks are built by spawning new *partial* code chunks from a single, user-input code chunk.  The partial code chunks build up and are display consecutively in a slide show alongside its output which yields a movie-like experience; this should make each step easier to understand.  

As you begin with flipbooks, I'd recommend using the code chunk option `include = F` for your "source" code chunks, and with no caching throughout.  As you begin to get more comfortable with flipbooking, you might change these choices.


---

## Set-up

We use the flipbookr package, of course! This does the work of disassembling a single code chunk and creating the "build" of multiple partial-code chunks.  

```{r, cache = FALSE}
library(flipbookr)
```

Also, I set *code chunk* options for the code chunks that follow.  These will apply to the spawned code chunks.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = "", cache = FALSE, fig.retina = 3)
```


<!-- So that I can sometimes work interactively on the package, I still am making the local source script available for myself.-->


```{r, cache = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
try(source("../../../../../R/base_parse_reveal_xaringan.R"))
```







---

# Using `flipbookr::chunk_reveal()`

You will use the `chunk_reveal()` function [inline](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-4.html) to generate the derivitive code chunks, rather than inside of a code chunk, so that the text that is generated is interpreted correctly when rendered.  The inline code will look something like this:

<!-- The above is for the html output version, just look at the examples below if you are in the source! -->
```markdown
``r "r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = \"cars\", break_type = \"user\", display_type = \"both\", left_assign = FALSE)"``
``` 


There are several modalities that you might be interested in using for "flipbookifying" your code and the next section is dedicated to demoing some of them below.

- **break type** -- *which lines of code should be revealed when*, `break_type` defaults to "auto"
- **display type** -- *display code and output, or just output, or just code?*, `display_type` defaults to "both"
- **assignment type** -- *does code chunk use left assignment?*, `left_assign` defaults to FALSE



---

At first we'll apply our flipbooking to the below input code - the code chunk is named "cars".  For now I set echo = TRUE for this code chunk, so you can see the code content but sometimes you might like to set echo to FALSE. This code uses tidyverse tools, so we'll load that too in a previous code chunk. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r cars, include = FALSE}
cars %>%
  filter(speed > 4) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) + #BREAK
  geom_point(
    alpha = .3, #BREAK2
    color = "blue" #BREAK3
    ) + #BREAK
  aes(size = speed) #BREAK
```

---

# `break_type`



Notice the regular comments and the special #BREAK comments, these will be used for a couple of the different "break type" modalities.


```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

<!-- Also notice how we've created a new code chunk with the code from the previous chunk. -->
<!-- This slide is also about giving you some intuition about how flipbooking works in the background. -->
<!-- (more on this [here](https://emitanaka.rbind.io/post/knitr-knitr-code/)) -->


---

## break_type = "auto"

One parameter of flipbooking is the break_type.  The default is "auto", in which appropriate breakpoints are determined automatically --- by finding where parentheses are balanced. 

<!-- display the user input code as a refresher -->
```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```



---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "auto")`

---

## break_type = "user", with #BREAK

If the break_type is set to "user", the breakpoints are those indicated by the user with the special comment #BREAK

<!-- display the user input code as a refresher -->
```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "user")`

---

## break_type = "non_seq", with #BREAK2, #BREAK3

If the break_type is set to "non_seq", the breakpoints are those indicated by the user with the special numeric comment #BREAK2, #BREAK3 etc to indicate at which point in time the code should appear.  

<!-- display the user input code as a refresher -->
```{r, code = knitr::knit_code$get("cars"), eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```



---


`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "non_seq")`


---

## `break_type = 5` (or "entering the multiverse")

Another modality is to set break_type equal to a positive integer, indicating that you want the same code chunk to be displayed multiple times.  This makes the most sense in a setting where there is some randomization or random sampling and you want to see different realizations. Let's see this used on the user input code chunk "cars_multi", whose first step is to randomly sample rows from the data set cars with replacement.  

```{r cars_multi, include = FALSE, fig.height=5}
cars %>% 
  sample_frac(size = 1, replace = TRUE) %>%      
  ggplot() +              
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_count(
    alpha = .3,
    color = "blue" 
    ) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = range(cars$speed),
                  ylim = range(cars$dist)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.9, .2))
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars_multi", break_type = 3)`


---

# `display_type`

There are also different display modalities.  Namely you can indicate if you want "both" the code and the output displayed in your flipbookification, or just the "output" (perhaps to be used in a traditional presentation), or just the "code" (which might be used to kind of test student expectations about some code).  You have already seen the default where the parameter display_type is set to "both", but let's have a look at "output" and "code" only.


---

## `display_type = "output"`

Let's look at where only the *output* is displayed for the "cars" code chunk.


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "user", display_type = "output")`

---

## `display_type = "code"`

And now where only the *code* is displayed for the "cars" code chunk.


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars", break_type = "auto", display_type = "code")`



---

# Assignment

If you want to create an object in your flipbooks, it is most "natural" to use [right assignment](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html).  Working sequentially with a pipeline of code, you get feedback all along the way until you get to the point of assigning all of what you have done to a new object with right assignment.  With left assignment in R, you don't get any feedback, so flipbooking prefers this step at the end of a pipeline, so we can enjoy all the nice feedback. So the parameter left_assign is by default set to FALSE.



---


# `left_assign = TRUE`


But, setting the left_assign paramter to T and using left assignment, you can still create a meaningful flipbook that gives you feedback.   When left_assign = TRUE, the first object that is created prints at the end of the derivative code chunks. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("left_assign", break_type = "auto", display_type = "both", left_assign = TRUE)`


```{r left_assign, include = FALSE}
my_plot <- cars %>%   # the data  
  filter(speed > 4) %>%  # subset
  ggplot() +       # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point()
```




---

# Managing source code chunks

So, it is pretty cool that we can create a bunch of derivative code chunks from one input code chunk (more on this [here](https://emitanaka.rbind.io/post/knitr-knitr-code/)).  But there are some considerations then for this source chunk.  What should its chunk options be? 

If there are dependenceies between code chunks, you may need to turn the code chunk option `eval` to TRUE (and usually echo = FALSE).  This may be the case when you create an object in one code chunk that you use in a subsequent code chunk.  

---

`r chunk_reveal("plot_object")`

```{r plot_object, include = FALSE}
cars %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point() ->
cars_plot
```


---


`r chunk_reveal("further_building")`

```{r further_building, include = FALSE}
cars_plot +
  labs(x = "Speed (mph)") + 
  labs(y = "Stopping distance (ft)")
```



---

# Beyond the tidyverse

It is no surprise that Flipbooks are born in the context of the popularity of the tidyverse tools --- tools that are designed be be used in sequential pipelines and that give a satisfying amount of feedback along the way!

But base R techniques and other popular tools can certainly also be employed.  

---

# "chaining" by overwriting objects

---

`r chunk_reveal("left_assign2", break_type = "auto", display_type = "both", left_assign = TRUE)`


```{r left_assign2, include = FALSE}
cars_mod <- cars
cars_mod$half_dist <- cars$dist / 2
names(cars_mod)[2] <- "distance"
cars_mod <- cars_mod[cars_mod$distance > 10,]
cars_mod <- cars_mod["distance"]
```


---

## using the .[] and .[[]] syntax with the migrittr pipe - %>%

Flipbooking can also be applied to logical indexing workflows if the steps are broken up using the %>% followed by .[] and .[[]].  Thus flipbooking can also be used with base R logical indexing and with the popular `data.table` package. 


---

`r chunk_reveal("dot_notation")`

```{r dot_notation, include = FALSE}
cars %>% 
  .[cars$speed > median(cars$speed),] %>% 
  .["speed"] %>% 
  .[,1] ->
top_speeds
```

---


# Base R plotting

It has been a while since I've done much plotting with base R, but I think it is important to have an example or two. 

---

`r chunk_reveal("base_r_plotting")`

```{r base_r_plotting, include = FALSE}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", 
     ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, 
             f = 2/3, iter = 3), 
      col = "red")
title(main = "the `cars` data")
title(sub = "Data is from Ezekiel's (1930) 'Methods of Correlation Analysis'.")
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("cars_anova")`

```{r cars_anova, include = FALSE, fig.keep='none'}
## An example of polynomial regression
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", 
     ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
    las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))
lm(dist ~ poly(speed, 3), 
   data = cars) -> 
model
seq(0, 25, length.out = 25) ->
inputs_of_x  
predict(model, 
        data.frame(speed = inputs_of_x)) ->
prediction_y
lines(inputs_of_x, 
      prediction_y, 
      col = "blue")
```

## Change slide show look and feel

To quickly change the look and feel of your xaringan slide show, you might check out the [available themes](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes#avaliable-themes) from the xaringan packaga and [xaringanthemer](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer) package.

Another extremely useful resource for xaringan styling is Alison Hill's ["Meet xaringan: Making slides in R Markdown"](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html).
