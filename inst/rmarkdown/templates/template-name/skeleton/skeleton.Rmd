# Introduction

This is a minimal example to demonstrate how to create a flipbook with data from #TidyTuesday.  It walks through data wrangling and plots pipelines made with the Tidyverse.  The functions that make this possible are the work of Emi Tanaka, Garrick Aden-Buie and myself, and are built for Xaringan, an Rmarkdown file type for creating presentation slides; the functions make use of the function `knitr:::knit_code$get()`.

The code to create the flipbook is an .Rmd that you can download [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvaMaeRey/little_flipbooks_library/master/tidytuesday_minimal_example/tidytuesday_minimal_example.Rmd).

# What's the slow ggplot style?

"Slow ggplot" just means working more incrementally than is typical. Elements of the approach are as follows:

- pulling out aes() from the ggplot() function:  
- using fewer functions; example - using labs() to add a title instead of ggtitle()
- using functions multiple times; example aes(x = var1) + aes(y = var2) rather than aes(x = var1, y = var2)
- using base R functions and tidyverse functions.  For other packages, the :: style to call them
- write out arguments (no shortcuts)  aes(x = gdppercap) not aes(gdppercap)
- order ggplot commands so that reactivity is obvious; scale adjustments to aesthetics might also be near the aesthetic declaration. 






---

Here, I contrast the usual plotting method to slow ggplotting:

Usual approach:

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(my_data, aes(var1, y = var2, col = var3)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("My Title") +
  labs(x = "the x label", y = "the y label", col = "legend title")
```

Using slow ggplotting: 

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = my_data) +
  aes(x = var1) +
  aes(y = var2) +
  geom_point() +
  aes(col = var3) +
  labs(y = "the y label") +
  labs(x = "the x label") +
  labs(col = "legend title") +
  labs(title = "My title")
```


# You may have seen the ggplot flipbook


# We've come along way

- adding pipe and other connections
- allowed code wrapping - responsible piping.  







---

# Set up

Okay. Let's load the the `flipbookr` and the `tidyverse` packages.

```{r, cache = F}
library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
```

And load the data from the tidytuesday github page. 

```{r}
# nobel_winners <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-05-14/nobel_winners.csv")
# source("../../../../../R/flipbook_mini.R")
# source("../../../../../R/base_parse_reveal_xaringan.R")
# source("../../../../../R/non_sequential_reveal.R")
```

---

# Where we are going: 

We'll create this plot.  I have **echo** set to FALSE in the code chunk options here so that you don't see the code, and **eval** to TRUE so that the plot output is produced.  The code chunk is given the name "nobel", and this is used in the in apply_reveal function, which breaks down code by wrangling and plot statements. 

```{r nobel, echo = F, eval = T, fig.height=5}
cars %>%             # the data  #REVEAL
  filter(speed > 4) %>%  # subset
  ggplot() +              # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  # Describing what follows
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + #REVEAL
  aes(color =
  speed > 14
  ) %+%
  cars
```
 

 
---

# How do we get there?

In the next slide, we'll walk through the code that produces this plot, and the output along the way. We use the code `apply_reveal("nobel")` in-line to access the code from the code chunk called *nobel*.
 
---

`r apply_reveal("nobel")`

# Embracing reverse assignment

# A second approach: Separate the data manipulation from the plotting.

If you'd like, you can also save your manipulated data and then plot, using the `%>%` to create your pipe line, and then reverse assignment operator `->`.  An example follows. 

---

```{r data_transformation, echo = F, eval = T, fig.height=5}
cars %>%             # the data  #REVEAL
  filter(speed > 4) %>% 
  mutate(var = 2) ->
my_data
```


---

`r apply_reveal("data_transformation")`

---

# Plotting the transformed data (and *not* revealing your plot in advance -- *just* showing the build).

Now you can use the transformed data to start the plot.  

Note that you also might prefer a behavior where you don't show a preview of the finished plot in advance.  I show an example of this below. I don't evaluate the code chunk (i.e. I've set eval to FALSE) and I don't echo it (i.e. echo is set to false). This means that the code chunk itself won't yeild any output (code or plot) to be put on a slide.  This means that I don't need to use the dashes, \-\-\- to separate the code chunk from the `apply_reveal()` statement, which differs from previous set-ups where a slide separator directly preceded the `apply_reveal()` call. 

---

```{r just_plotting, echo = F, eval = FALSE, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = my_data) +              # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  # Describing what follows
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + #REVEAL
  aes(
    color = speed > 14
  ) %+%
  cars
```


`r apply_reveal("just_plotting")`

```{r}
# make_flipbook_mini_chunk(chunk_name = "just_plotting", file_out = "a_flipbook_mini_example.gif")
```

---

# Can't stomach reverse assignment?


---

```{r regular_assignment, eval = T, echo = F}
a_plot <- cars %>%             # the data  #REVEAL
  filter(speed > 4) %>%  # subset
  ggplot() +              # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  # Describing what follows
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + #REVEAL
  aes(color =
  speed > 14
  ) %+%
  cars
```

`r apply_reveal("regular_assignment", reg_assignment = T)`




---

# User defined reveal

---

```{r user_definded_reveal, eval = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = my_data) +   # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = speed) + 
  aes(y = dist) + #REVEAL
  # Describing what follows 
  geom_blank() +
  geom_point(data = my_data %>% slice(1)) + #REVEAL
  geom_point() #REVEAL
```

`r apply_reveal("user_definded_reveal", user_reveal = T)`


---

# For use in traditional presentations.

---


```{r slow_traditional_presentation, eval = F, echo = F}
gapminder::gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  ggplot() + # pipe to ggplot
  aes(x = gdpPercap) + #REVEAL
  aes(y = lifeExp) + #REVEAL
  # Describing what follows
  geom_point() +
  aes(alpha = country == "New Zealand") + 
  scale_alpha_discrete(limits = c(0, 1), guide = F) + #REVEAL 
  aes(alpha = NULL) + #REVEAL
  aes(size = pop) + #REVEAL 
  aes(color = continent) #REVEAL 
```

`r apply_reveal("slow_traditional_presentation", show_code = F, user_reveal = T)`



---

# Non sequential reveal (or can't stomach "slow ggplot"?)

---

```{r non_sequential, eval = F, echo = F}
cars %>%
  mutate(speed_14_plus = speed >= 14) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  # Describing what follows
  geom_point(
    size = 2, #REVEAL2
    alpha = .3, #REVEAL3
    color = "blue", #REVEAL4
    ) +
  aes(color = speed_14_plus)
```



---

# Non-traditional pipelines 

---

```{r logical_indexing, eval = F, echo = F}
list(thing_1 = "a",
     thing_2 = matrix(data = 1:5, nrow = 2)) ->
my_named_list
list("a",
1:5,
my_named_list) %>%
.[[3]] %>%
.$thing_2 %>%
.[3]
```


`r apply_reveal("logical_indexing")`

---


# data.table



---

# Multiple realizations


---

```{r many_realizations, eval = F, echo = F}
tibble(tail_length = rnorm(n = 50), 
       brain_weight = rnorm(n = 50)) ->
my_data; my_data %>% slice(1:3)

ggplot(data = my_data) +
  aes(x = tail_length) +
  aes(y = brain_weight) +
  geom_point(alpha = .8,
             color = "steelblue",
             size = 6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-3,3),
                  ylim = c(-3,3))

cor.test(x = my_data$tail_length,
         y = my_data$brain_weight)
```


`r apply_repeat_reveal(chunk_name = "many_realizations", num_reveal = 10)`
